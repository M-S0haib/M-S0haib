# Hi, I'm M. Sohaib

I'm a developer focused on building AI-powered products with strong software and seamless user experiences.  
I work across **Agentic AI**, **front-end development**, and **AI model integration** to create smart, modern applications.

### What I Do
- Build AI agents using tools like **CrewAI** and **OpenAI Agent SDK**
- Develop sleek UIs with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **shadcn**, and modern CSS libraries
- Integrate **LLMs and AI models** directly into web apps
- Work with **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, and explore **FastAPI** and **MySQL**

I enjoy bridging the gap between intelligent systems and intuitive interfaces.
